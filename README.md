# WinForms-Application
I Create a C# Windows Forms application for capturing and displaying screen colors.

## Brief Description

**ScreenColor** is a C# Windows Forms application that allows users to capture and display the color of any point on their screen. 
By holding down the mouse button, users can select a specific color, which is then displayed in a panel along with its HTML color code and RGB values. 
The application also provides functionality to lock the color selection and copy the color information to the clipboard.
